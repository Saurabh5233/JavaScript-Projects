Here I have made some Projects in JavaScript, Html and CSS


## Project 1

This is a simple Project that gives the weather report of the location you enter.

## Project 2
[Click Here](https://saurabh5233.github.io/JavaScript-Projects/TicTacToe/)

This is a Tic-Tac-Toe game that you often play on paper.
